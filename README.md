# Beautiful Soup Webscraper

This webscraper uses Beautiful Soup and python to scrape data from the internet! 
It was specifically made to get the data from Indeed Software developer jobs by giving the city and state locations through command line.
However it can easily be modified by inspecting elements of a static webpage and changing the ones that were searched for.
Once it has found the elements, it creates a file called internships.txt and formats the internship opportunities for you to apply to!
