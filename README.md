# Beautiful Soup Webscraper

This webscraper uses Beautiful Soup and python to scrape data from the internet! <br >
It was specifically made to get the data from Indeed Software developer jobs by giving the city and state locations through command line. <br  >
However it can easily be modified by inspecting elements of a static webpage and changing the ones that were searched for. <br  >
Once it has found the elements, it creates a file called internships.txt and formats the internship opportunities for you to apply to!
<br  >
How to use it: <br  >
Run "python webscraper.py" (or "python3 webscraper.py" if using python3) to get the application running <br  >
Enter the city and state abbreviation of the software developer job listings you would like to receive <br  >
The webscraper will automatically create a file with the job listings that it finds. Now go apply to those jobs!
